## Development

This plugin is tightly coupled to the ShopChop theme. CSS for all widget output lives in the theme's Tailwind stylesheet — the plugin itself ships no styles.

**Plugin slug:** `shopchop-theme-settings`  
**Text domain:** `shopchop-theme-settings`  
**Prefix:** `ShopChop_` (classes), `shopchop_` (functions/hooks)
